# IXO Blockchain Node Upgrades

This document describes two kinds of upgrades:

- **Binary Upgrade** Frequent and painless upgrade of the IXO Blockchain binary when using Cosmovisor - this can happen once a week, if so desired.
- **Chain Upgrade** Very seldom and only when absolutely necessary in order to start from a specific genesis - only required in severe cases where the chain halted without being able to recover.

The IXO testnet and mainnet have been stable for a number of years and the chains were last upgraded about 2 years ago.

The IXO Blockchain binary is upgraded often.  
**Important:** Ensure that Cosmovisor is installed for your node to make binary upgrades seamless.
