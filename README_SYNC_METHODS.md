# IXO Blockchain Node Synchronisation

In order to become a part of the validator set, your node data has to be synced to the rest of the validator set.  
This guide describes the available options, their pros & cons, and how they relate in terms of speed and security.

When setting up a new node on the IXO Impact Hub chain (or any Cosmos-based blockchain), there are three primary methods to catch up with the validators and synchronize your node with the network

## Full Sync (Default Method)

This is the most secure but slowest way to synchronize your node with the blockchain.

**Note**

- Ensure that you install v0.20.0 of ixo-blockchain.
- Allow the Cosmovisor binary updates to be installed at the correct block heights.

### How It Works

‚Ä¢ Your node downloads all historical blocks from genesis and verifies each transaction.
‚Ä¢ This ensures full validation and security but takes considerable time, depending on network traffic and hardware.

### Steps

1. Install and configure the node software named `ixod` for Impact Hub.
2. Start the node with:

```bash
ixod start
```

3. The node will fetch all historical blocks and validate them.

### Pros

‚úÖ Most secure‚Äîensures the integrity of all historical transactions.  
‚úÖ No reliance on third-party sources.

### Cons

‚ùå Very slow‚Äîcould take several days to fully sync.  
‚ùå High resource usage‚Äîrequires ample disk space and bandwidth.

## State Sync (Fastest Method)

This is the fastest way to catch up with the validator set that:

- Downloads only the most recent application state (the current state of all accounts, balances, and smart contracts)
- Skips downloading and verifying historical blocks entirely
- Requires trust in the RPC providers offering the state sync service
- Gets your node operational in minutes to hours

**Note**

- Ensure that you install the latest version of ixo-blockchain; currently v4.0.0.
- Make sure that you absolutely trust the source.

### How It Works

- Your node connects to trusted RPC servers
- It downloads a snapshot of the current blockchain state at a specific trusted height
- It verifies this state against a trusted hash
- Your node immediately starts participating in consensus from that point forward

### Instructions

Using the STAVR StateSync facilities.

```bash
systemctl stop ixod
SNAP_RPC=https://ixo.rpc.m.stavr.tech:443
LATEST_HEIGHT=$(curl -s $SNAP_RPC/block | jq -r .result.block.header.height); \
BLOCK_HEIGHT=$((LATEST_HEIGHT - 1000)); \
TRUST_HASH=$(curl -s "$SNAP_RPC/block?height=$BLOCK_HEIGHT" | jq -r .result.block_id.hash)

echo $LATEST_HEIGHT $BLOCK_HEIGHT $TRUST_HASH

sed -i.bak -E "s|^(enable[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1true| ; \
s|^(rpc_servers[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1\"$SNAP_RPC,$SNAP_RPC\"| ; \
s|^(trust_height[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1$BLOCK_HEIGHT| ; \
s|^(trust_hash[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1\"$TRUST_HASH\"| ; \
s|^(seeds[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1\"\"|" $HOME/.ixod/config/config.toml
ixod tendermint unsafe-reset-all --home /home/ixo/.ixod
wget -O $HOME/.ixod/config/addrbook.json "https://server-1.stavr.tech/Mainnet/Ixo/addrbook.json"
curl -o - -L https://ixo.wasm.stavr.tech/wasm-ixod.tar.lz4 | lz4 -c -d - | tar -x -C $HOME/.ixod
sudo systemctl restart ixod && journalctl -fu ixod -o cat
```

### Steps

1. Enable state sync by finding an available state sync provider (like an RPC node that offers snapshots).
2. Modify the node‚Äôs config.toml with the provider‚Äôs details:

```plaintext
[statesync]
enable = true
rpc_servers = "https://rpc-provider1.com,https://rpc-provider2.com"
trust_height = <latest height>
trust_hash = "<block hash at trusted height>"
```

3. Restart the node:

```bash
ixod start
```

4. The node fetches the latest snapshot and syncs instantly.

### Pros

‚úÖ Fastest method‚Äîminutes to a few hours instead of days.  
‚úÖ Low resource usage‚Äîdoes not require storing full historical data.

### Cons

‚ùå Relies on trusted RPC providers‚Äîif compromised, security may be affected.  
‚ùå Not suitable for archive nodes (which need full historical data).

## Snapshot Sync (Midway Between Full Sync & State Sync)

Snapshot Sync is a middle ground approach that:

- Downloads a compressed archive of blockchain data up to a recent height
- Includes more historical data than state sync
- Still requires downloading and extracting large files (gigabytes)
- Takes more time than state sync but less than full sync

**Note**

- Ensure that you install the latest version of ixo-blockchain; currently v4.0.0.

### How It Works

‚Ä¢ The node downloads a snapshot file containing the blockchain state up to a certain block height.
‚Ä¢ After extracting it, the node resumes normal syncing from that height onwards.

- Download a tarball/archive of blockchain data
- Extract it to your node's data directory
- Your node still needs to sync blocks from the snapshot point to the current height
- More verification happens compared to state sync

### Steps

1. Find a snapshot provider from the IXO community or snapshot services.
2. Download and extract the snapshot:

```bash
wget -O snapshot.tar.gz <snapshot-url>
tar -xzvf snapshot.tar.gz -C ~/.ixod
```

3. Start the node:

```bash
ixod start
```

### Pros

‚úÖ Much faster than full sync but more secure than state sync.  
‚úÖ Can be restarted from a recent height without relying on third-party RPCs.

### Cons

‚ùå Requires downloading large snapshot files (~GBs).  
‚ùå Still takes some time to sync beyond the snapshot height.

## Which Method Should You Choose?

| Method | Speed üöÄ | Security üîí | Best Use Case |  
| Full Sync | üêå Slow | ‚úÖ Most Secure| If you want full transaction history. |  
| State Sync | ‚ö° Fast | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Trust | If you want the fastest startup and are okay with using trusted providers. |  
| Snapshot Sync | üèÉ Medium | ‚úÖ Secure | If you want a balance of speed and security. |

### Final Recommendation

- If you need speed - Use State Sync.
- If you need security - Use Full Sync.
- If you need a balance - Use Snapshot Sync.
